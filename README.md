<img width="1440" height="900" alt="signo sc1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc5f78fc-c426-42c0-95a1-2e0a662a3396" />


**Signo** is a real-time, interactive hand gesture recognition application demonstrating sentence building through gesture input. Built with **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**, it uses geometric classification to recognize assigned hand shapes mapped to common words and phrases, enabling users to build sentences directly from webcam gestures.

**🚀 Live Demo:** [Signo on Streamlit Cloud](https://signo.streamlit.app) *(Interface preview - webcam requires local deployment)*

## 🖐️ Assigned Gesture Mappings

The application recognizes hand shapes assigned to common words and phrases for interactive sentence building (these are **not authentic KSL signs** but demo gestures for HCI education):

**Word Shapes:**
- ✊ "I" (Fist), ✋ "YOU" (Flat hand), 🅰️ "AM" (A shape), 🤟 "GOOD" (L shape)
- ✌️ "WE" (V shape), 🤙 "SEE" (Y shape), 🖕 "ME" (I shape)

**Phrase Shapes:**
- HELLO (Flat hand with thumb left), THANK YOU (Fist with thumb right extended)
- GOOD DAY (V shape with thumb added)

**Control Gestures:**
- ✋ SPACE: Flat hand with thumb right (add space between words)
- 👊 DELETE: Thumb-index pinch (remove last word/phrase)
- 👍 ENTER: Thumbs up (complete sentence with period)

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd signo-gesture-recognition
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The application relies on `streamlit`, `opencv-python`, and `mediapipe`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main script using Streamlit.

    ```bash
    streamlit run final.py
    ```

    The application will launch in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

### 🚀 Quick Start (Single Command)

For the easiest setup, use the automated script that handles everything:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd signo-gesture-recognition

# Run everything with one command
./run_app.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Install ngrok if not present
- ✅ Install Python dependencies automatically
- ✅ Start the Streamlit application
- ✅ Create a public ngrok tunnel
- ✅ Display the shareable URL
- ✅ Handle cleanup when stopped

**Perfect for sharing with others!** Just give them the repository and tell them to run `./run_app.sh`.

## 🛠️ Classification Details (For Developers)

The core logic resides in the `is_finger_open` and `classify_gesture` functions.

1.  **Finger Open Check (`is_finger_open`):**
    A finger is considered **open** if its **tip's** $y$-coordinate is *smaller* than its corresponding **PIP** (Proximal Interphalangeal) joint's $y$-coordinate.
    * *Rationale:* In image coordinates, the $y$-axis increases downwards. When a finger is extended vertically, the tip is positioned "higher" (smaller $y$ value) than the joint closer to the palm. This makes the detection robust regardless of hand size or distance from the camera.

2.  **Gesture Mapping (`classify_gesture`):**
    This function checks the combined state (open/closed) of the four non-thumb fingers (Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky) to match them against the predefined gesture patterns. A special case is implemented for **👍 Thumbs Up** which requires both a specific finger state *and* the thumb tip to be positioned above the wrist.

3.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    The `asl_trainer.py` module provides comprehensive model training with:
    - Cross-validation for robust performance estimation
    - Confusion matrix analysis for error patterns
    - Per-class accuracy breakdown
    - Automatic metrics export for UI display
